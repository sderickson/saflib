# Overview

`saflib` contains all the shared code across all SAF-based projects. It is a flat list of packages, spanning common dependencies and reusable features. It also stores all the documentation for both human and agent consumption.

[This site](https://docs.saf-demo.online/) provides a quick way to review the docs in a nice format, but you can also find these docs while you are coding with SAF by searching for their markdown files.

To use these packages, you can create a project from [the official SAF template repo](https://github.com/sderickson/saf-template). You can also use the [SAF website repo](https://github.com/sderickson/saf-2025) as reference. The latter is what builds and serves this documentation using [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/).
