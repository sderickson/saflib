     * a set of tests require different vi.mock setups. For example, one test might mock an
     * external dependency, but another runs first and imports the file that would receive the mock.
     * It will not because that file will have already been loaded.
     *
     * So, removing test isolation is opt-in. Seems best when testing purely functional code. No
     * mocks, no globals, no side effects.
