# Development

## Roadmap

The workflow tool is early on in development, so the roadmap does not extend far into the future. To see what is planned, and what has been done, see the [SAF GitHub project](https://github.com/users/sderickson/projects/2/views/4). These tend to be updated on a monthly basis. I also use [milestones](https://github.com/sderickson/saflib/milestones) to group issues and think in larger goals.

Right now features are determined by what I need to build out whatever projects I'm working on. As this library is adopted by others, I'll work to plan based on others' needs as well. Please submit [issues](https://github.com/sderickson/saflib/issues) for feature requests or bug reports.
