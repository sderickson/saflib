# Interface: XStateMachineStates

State objects which can be passed into [XStateMachine Actor Definitions](https://stately.ai/docs/state-machine-actors). These are typed simply here because I'll be damned if I can figure out how to use the XState library's provided generics.

## Indexable

\[`key`: `string`\]: `object`
